            <h3>Etymology & History</h3>
            <p>
              The name Siem Reap (សៀមរាប) means "Defeat of Siam," referencing
              past conflicts with Thailand. Historically, the city gained
              significance in the 19th century when French explorers documented
              the ruins of Angkor, leading to restoration efforts and
              international recognition.
            </p>
