            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The name "Kampong Chhnang" translates from Khmer literally to
              "Port of Pottery." Archaeological remains from the area have
              revealed artifacts from Dvaravati, a former kingdom in present-day
              Thailand, dating to the 6th through 11th centuries. Centuries ago,
              Kampong Chhnang was a coastal city on the route between China and
              India; due to sedimentation from the Mekong River, the coastline
              moved. When the Tonle Sap river changed its course, the city lost
              its main water source and was deserted, with the population moving
              to a city called Kampong Tralach. A city gradually formed around
              it, bringing new life to Kampong Chhnang. A museum presents the
              archaeological record of the city's history.
