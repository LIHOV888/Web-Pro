            <h3>Etymology & History</h3>
            <p>
              The name Siem Reap (សៀមរាប) means "Defeat of Siam," referencing
              past conflicts with Thailand. Historically, the city gained
              significance in the 19th century when French explorers documented
              the ruins of Angkor, leading to restoration efforts and
              international recognition.
            </p>
            <h3>Economy & Tourism</h3>
            <p>
              Siem Reap’s economy is heavily reliant on tourism, with over 50%
              of jobs linked to the industry. By 2012, tourist arrivals had
              surpassed two million. The city has developed a strong hospitality
              sector, with luxury hotels, traditional markets, and vibrant
              nightlife.

            <h3>Temple of Preah Vihear</h3>
            <p>
              Situated on the edge of a plateau that dominates the plain of
              Cambodia, the Temple of Preah Vihear is dedicated to Shiva. The
              Temple is composed of a series of sanctuaries linked by a system
              of pavements and staircases over an 800 metre long axis and dates
              back to the first half of the 11th century AD. Nevertheless, its
              complex history can be traced to the 9th century, when the
              hermitage was founded. This site is particularly well preserved,
              mainly due to its remote location. The site is exceptional for the
              quality of its architecture, which is adapted to the natural
              environment and the religious function of the temple, as well as
              for the exceptional quality of its carved stone ornamentation.
