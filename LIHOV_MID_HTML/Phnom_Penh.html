              Khmer. It is derived from the legend of Lady Penh, who is said to
              have founded the city after discovering sacred Buddhist relics on
              a hill, now known as Wat Phnom.

              period, earning the nickname "Pearl of Asia" for its beautiful
              architecture and vibrant culture.
